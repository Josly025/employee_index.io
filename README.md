    The Employee Index application is essentially a directory for storing employee data. All employees can be viewed through an easy to navigate table and search field. A second, "All Employees" button, can be used to reset the table to list all employees. Employee information includes an image, Name, Phone Number, Email, and Date of Birth for each individual.
